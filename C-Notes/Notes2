conditionals:

IF statement //if the condition is true the body will get executed
	syntax:
	 	if ( 1==1){		// if 1 is equal to 1 then it will print "true"
		printf("true");
		}
ELSE statement //if the IF statement is false then else will get executed
	syntax:
		if (1==2){		// if 1 is equal to 2 then it will print "true"
		printf("true);;
		}
		else{			//but 1 is not equal to 2 so else will get executed and printf "false"
		printf("false");
		}
ELSE IF statement // if the IF statement is false then it will check the ELSE IF statement and if its true then it will get executed
	syntax:
		
	 	if ( 1==2){		// if 1 is equal to 2 then it will print "true"
		printf("true");
		}
		else if (1==3){		// 1 is not equal to 2 so it will check the ELSE IF statement
		printf("yes");		// if 1 is equal to 3 then it will print "yes"
		}			// but 1 is not equal to 3 so it wont print anything


switch syntax:

	switch(name of variable){
		case 1: 	// if the variable contains 1 then the body of case 1 will get executed
		body
		break; 		// break is used to separate cases, 
		case 2: 	// if there's no break then the body of other case will get executed until it encounter break
		break;
		default:	//works the same as else, if all are false then default will get executed
		body
	}			// {} is not needed in each cases unless you want to separate them 
				// like for making different variables with same names
